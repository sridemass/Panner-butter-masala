Soak cashews in a hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, preparing ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.
Then drain and add the soaked cashews in a blender or grinder.
Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and grind to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or pieces of cashews.
In the same blender add the roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.
Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Keep aside. Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.
Making Tomato Gravy
Melt butter in a pan on a low flame. Add tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil become fragrant.
Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma disappears.
Add the tomato puree and stir well. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Then add kashmiri red chili powder and stir again. Continue to sauté till the oil starts to leave the sides of the tomato paste. The tomato paste will thicken considerably and will start coming together as one whole lump. 
Then add cashew paste and stir well. Sauté the cashew paste for a few minutes till the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala paste.
The cashew paste will begin to cook fast. Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a low flame. So keep stirring non-stop.
